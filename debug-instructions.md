# üîç Debug Instructions for Blank Screen

## Current Status
- Dev server is running successfully on port 8082
- HMR (Hot Module Replacement) is working - code changes are being detected
- I've added an Error Boundary and a simple test page to help debug

## What to Check Now

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open localhost:8082 in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Check the **Console** tab for any red error messages
4. Check the **Network** tab to see if files are loading

### Step 2: Test Different Routes
Try these URLs to isolate the issue:

1. **Root page**: http://localhost:8082/
   - Should show the original wm-foundations homepage
   
2. **Content route**: http://localhost:8082/content
   - Should now show a simple test page with green checkmarks
   - If still blank, there's a deeper issue

3. **Deal tracking**: http://localhost:8082/deal-tracking
   - Should show the existing deal tracking page

### Step 3: Check What You See

#### If you see the test page (‚úÖ Good!)
The test page should show:
```
üéâ Content Engine Test
If you can see this, React is working correctly!
‚úÖ React Components Working
‚úÖ Tailwind CSS Working  
‚úÖ TypeScript Working
[Test Button]
```

#### If you see an error page (üîç Helpful!)
The error boundary will show:
- The specific error message
- Stack trace
- This tells us exactly what's breaking

#### If still completely blank (‚ùå Deeper issue)
This means the issue is with:
- Basic React rendering
- JavaScript errors preventing app startup
- Browser compatibility issues

## What to Report Back

Please let me know:

1. **What do you see** at http://localhost:8082/content?
   - Test page with checkmarks?
   - Error boundary with error details?  
   - Still completely blank?

2. **Console errors** (if any):
   - Copy/paste any red error messages from browser console

3. **Network tab**:
   - Are CSS/JS files loading successfully?
   - Any failed requests (red status codes)?

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Hard Refresh
- Press Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- This clears browser cache

### Fix 2: Check Different Browser
- Try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
- Some browsers may have different compatibility

### Fix 3: Check JavaScript Enabled
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Some ad blockers can interfere

## If Test Page Works

If the test page shows correctly, then React is working and we just need to gradually add back the complex components. I can then:

1. Restore the simple ContentDashboardSimple 
2. Test each component one by one
3. Find which specific component is causing the issue

## Next Steps

Once I know what you're seeing, I can:
- Fix the specific error if there is one
- Gradually add back components to isolate the problematic one
- Provide a working solution

The dev server is running perfectly, so the issue is likely a component-level error that the Error Boundary will catch and show us.
