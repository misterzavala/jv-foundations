- Context-based state management

## Database Schema

### Current Tables

#### `deals`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- created_at (timestamp)
- details (jsonb)
- motivation (text)
- status (text, default: 'in_review')
- media_links (text array)
- notes (text)
- partner_name (text)
- partner_email (text)
- seller_name (text)
- seller_phone (text)
- seller_email (text)
- property_address (text)
```

#### `card_preferences`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- card_type (text, unique)
- is_visible (boolean, default: true)
- position (integer)
- size (text, default: 'standard')
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

### Migration History
1. Initial card preferences table
2. Size column addition
3. Size constraint updates (small/medium/large → compact/standard/expanded)
4. Data migration and constraint fixes
